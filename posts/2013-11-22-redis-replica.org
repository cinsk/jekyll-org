  Easy way to setup the local redis replication using GNU screen(1)

One of my reponsibility is to write easy client library for Redis in C
and Java.  There are already well-known client C library, [[https://github.com/redis/hiredis][hiredis]] and
Java library, [[https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis][jedis]].  At the time of development, none of these
support our Redis replication cluster.  I'll write later about the
client libraries that support replication.

Anyway, during the development, I need to launch simple redis cluster,
which consists of 1 master and 2 slaves.  It is tiresome job to setup
the configuration of master and slaves, and it is very likely to
commit a mistake.

Thus, I wrote a small shell script (called =redis-replica.sh=) to
launch redis cluster locally.  Internally, it uses [[https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/][GNU screen]] to
create multiple shell to launch required processes:

| shell no. | description                            |
|-----------+----------------------------------------|
|         0 | /redis-sentinel/, listening 26379      |
|         1 | redis monitor to the sentinel          |
|         2 | /redis-cli/ to the sentinel            |
|         3 | /redis-server/ master, listening 6379  |
|         4 | redis monitor to the master            |
|         5 | /redis-cli/ to the master              |
|         6 | /redis-server/ slave#1, listening 6380 |
|         7 | redis monitor to the slave#1           |
|         8 | /redis-cli/ to the slave#1             |
|         9 | /redis-server/ slave#2, listening 6381 |
|        10 | redis monitor to the slave#2           |
|        11 | /redis-cli/ to the slave#2             |

Since the master and slaves are managed by the /sentinel/ process, if
you shutdown the master, one of the slaves will be promoted to new
master.

This way, you can easily experiment and test your client software or
libraries.

Here is the source code of =redis-replica.sh=:
