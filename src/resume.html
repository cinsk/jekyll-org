      Of course, my strong field is in computer programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      My favorite programming languages are C, Java, Python, and Ruby.
      I have quite experiences on C++ but I don't prefer it.  And I
      have experiences on Emacs Lisp.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have experiences developing Xlib/GTK+, Windows/MFC, UNIX socket
      applications and libraries.

      I was a local C language lecturer of
      <a href="http://pcrc.hongik.ac.kr/">P.C.R.C.</a> from 1997 to 2002.
      During that time, include C courses, I had several seminars about
      mixed language programming, writing robust code,
      Pentium/P-Pro/P-MMX/P-II architectures, and C++ STL.

    <p>
      I've participated MPV/MA, SMAT project in Samsung Electronics so far.
      My primary job is developing low-memory-consuming XML library and
      <a href="http://www.osta.org/mpv/">MPV</a> parser. 2003-2004
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I've been a primary MPV developer and a primary MPV specification
        author in Samsung Electronics.
        I've been a main author of <em>Samsung MPV Implementation Guide</em>.
        Since it is still under development, it is available MPV members
        only; check it out at
        <a href="http://www.osta.org/mpv/public/specs.html">OSTA
          MPV Specification section</a> for mature MPV specifications.</li>
      <li>I'm the editor of MPV CE Working Group, and my primary
        work is to write the document, "<em>MPV Interoperability
          Specification</em>" that is available
        <a href="http://www.osta.org/mpv/public/is/mpv-is.htm">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I developed <em>libsxml</em> and have maintained it.
      <em>libsxml</em> is almost confirming DOM style XML processor --
      it uses less memory than other XML processor such as <a
      href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">expat</a> or <a
      href="http://www.minixml.org">mini XML</a> in storing XML tree
      structure. It supports XML namespace and entity
      declarations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>To parse and save an 1724KB-sized XML document into the memory,
        it uses 2471KB memory space. See the memory usage graph
        <a href="./img/libsxml-large.png">here</a>.</li>
      <li>to parse and save a 30KB-sized XML document into the memory,
        it uses 57KB memory space. See the memory usage graph
        <a href="./img/libsxml-small.png">here</a>.</li>

      <li>Note that these data are heavily dependent on the information
        stored in the XML documents. The more same strings it has, the
        smaller the memory consumption is.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <img src="./img/u-ca5.png" align="right" alt="U-CA5"/>
      I developed <em>libmpv</em>, which is MPV processor depends on
      <em>libsxml</em>. These two libraries are used in several Samsung
      cameras including U-CA5.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had participated MASH/Shadow project in Samsung Electronics.
      My primary job is optimizing and refactoring the software so that
      it can run faster with less memory. 2005-03
    </p>

    <p>
      I had participated SODI (Photo Player, SPL-07) project in Samsung
      Electronics:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>I developed generic interprocess communication(IPC) library,
        <em>libmsgq</em>.
      </li>
      <li>I developed MPV translator (called the
        <em>presenter</em>), which
        coordinates and manages media information among audio,
        video, image players.</li>
      <li>The GUI application behaves
        as a message queue server that
        receives requests from the uPNP device, and has an interface to the
        end users. The UI widgets are based on the
        <a href="http://www.paragui.org/">paragui</a>.

    <p>
      I had participated CE2.0 project (2007) to develop Internet-connected TV.
      My job was to develop a generic RSS parser, an EPG parser, a file
      transfer utility, and Open API for TV.
    </p>

    <p>
      I had joined the A-VSB standardization group in Samsung Electroncis, to
      help developing the standard document. (2007-06)
      <!-- My job is to write the
      Electronic Program Guide (EPG in short) section for A-VSB. -->
      Unfortunately, these are not my specialty, so that I'd little use of
      that group.

      (A-VSB is a modification of the 8VSB modulation system used for
      transmission of digital television using
      the <a href="http:://www.atsc.org/">ATSC</a> system. --
      <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>)

    <p>
      <!-- IDAHO -->
      (2007-2008), I have designed/written the OpenAPI specification for
      <a href="http://infolink.pavv.co.kr/">Power Infolink</a> (Korean) server
      that interacts with some Samsung LCD HDTVs (750 series). (These TVs
      utilize Internet RSS service such as news, stock quote,
      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> and so on.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <!-- InsenTV -->
    2009, On InsenTV project (further utilization of the previous one,) I'd
    participated to implement advertisement engine of TV.  And I developed
    several browser native plug-ins (such as Database plugin, screenshot
    plugin, etc.)  for the Javascript developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      2010, I joined UCX project.  It was a frontier project to test
      feasability and discovering of cloud computing technology.  I'd written
      'Service Specification for Personal Cloud', that extends/utilizes XMPP.

      Based on that specification, I'd implemented extended XMPP service
      daemon.  I implemented and enhanced XEP-0004, XEP-0050, XEP-0066; And
      most of device specific services are implemented on top of XEP-0050.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have learned grid computing
      middleware, called ICE.  I developed a distributed real-time
      video transcoder service for Internet TV, and developed device/file
      manager for various devices (e.g. TV, NAS, odroid/tablet, galaxy S),
      and developed virtual machine monitor.
