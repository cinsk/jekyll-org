* Introduction

This is the shortened English version of my Korea article,
[[file:gdb3.html][Debugging with GDB: gdbx.py]].

From GDB version 7.0 (I strongly recommend version 7.1 or higher,
though), GDB contains a Python interpreter so that it is possible to
use Python to create GDB init script.  I made some useful custom GDB
commands in Python; =hexdump=, =iconv=, and =xmllint=.  As you expect,
these commands are nothing more than a wrapper to call =hexdump(1)=,
=iconv(1)=, and =xmllint(1)=.

To use these commands, you need to insert following line in your ~.gdbinit~:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
source ~/src/gdb/gdbx.py
#+END_SRC

Here's the link to the repository: [[https://github.com/cinsk/gdb-scripts/blob/master/gdbx.py][github]]

The rest article explains how to use these custom commands.

* hexdump

While GDB =x= command prints various data in your custom format, it is
not still pretty (at least for me.)  GDB =hexdump= operates like GDB
=dump=, prints the data in =hexdump(1)=-like output:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
hexdump value EXPR [## OPTION...]
hexdump memory START_ADDR END_ADDR [## OPTION...]
#+END_SRC

If you want to print the value of an expression (i.e. variable), GDB
=hexdump value= is your choice.  To print the memory region, use GDB
=hexdump memory=:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
# Print the string constant, "hello, world"
(gdb) hexdump value "hello, world"
00000000  68 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 77  6f 72 6c 64 00           |hello, world.|
0000000d
# Print the value in the variable 'buffer'
(gdb) hexdump value buffer
00000000  3c 6d 65 73 73 61 67 65  20 66 72 6f 6d 3d 22 63  |<message from="c|
00000010  69 6e 73 6b 79 40 73 61  6d 73 75 6e 67 2e 63 6f  |insky@xxxxxxx.co|
00000020  6d 2f 74 76 22 20 74 6f  3d 22 63 69 6e 73 6b 79  |m/tv" to="cinsky|
00000030  40 73 61 6d 73 75 6e 67  2e 63 6f 6d 2f 77 65 62  |@xxxxxxx.com/web|
...
# Print the value (only the first 32 bytes)
(gdb) hexdump memory buffer ((char*)buffer+32)
00000000  3c 6d 65 73 73 61 67 65  20 66 72 6f 6d 3d 22 63  |<message from="c|
00000010  69 6e 73 6b 79 40 73 61  6d 73 75 6e 67 2e 63 6f  |insky@xxxxxxx.co|
00000020
(gdb) _
#+END_SRC

By default, GDB =hexdump= prints the data using =hexdump(1)= '-C'
option.  If you want use different option, add '##' in the
commandline, then add your options.  For example, to print the data in
octal format, use '-b' option:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(gdb) hexdump memory valid ((char*)valid+32) ## -b
0000000 074 155 145 163 163 141 147 145 040 146 162 157 155 075 042 143
0000010 151 156 163 153 171 100 163 141 155 163 165 156 147 056 143 157
0000020
(gdb) _
#+END_SRC

Refer to the man page of =hexdump(1)= for more options.

* iconv

If you want debug a program that uses various character encodings,
there are some cases like that (1) You want to verify the data in
specified character encoding, (2) You knew that the data contains
foreign language message, but you're not sure what kind of character
encoding it uses.

GDB =iconv= command make easy to solve above problems.

First, you need to set the system's default character encoding. (By
'system', I mean the internal Python interpreter's) To get or set the
system encoding you can use following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
iconv encoding [#ENCODING]
#+END_SRC

If you give no argument, GDB =iconv encoding= prints the current
default character encoding.  If you give one argument that incicates
certain encoding, GDB =iconv encoding= replace the current character
encoding to the specified one.

The argument, '#ENCODING' uses special form; the first character
should be always '#', uses only lower-case character, and you need to
substitute all non-alpha-numeric character to '_'.  For example, if
you want to use "ISO_8859-10:1992", your choice will be
"iso_8859_10_1992":

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(gdb) iconv encoding #iso_8859_10_1992
#+END_SRC

In general cases, most of modern Linux distribution uses "UTF-8" as
their default encoding, you may want to do:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(gdb) iconv encoding #utf_8
#+END_SRC

The actual conversion will be done with following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
iconv value EXPR #ENCODING [#ENCODING...]
iconv memory START_ADDR END_ADDR [#ENCODING...]
#+END_SRC

The meaning of EXPR, START_ADDR, and END_ADDR is the same as GDB
=hexdump= or GDB =dump= command.

For example, suppose that the char array, buffer contains a string,
and you are certain that it contains a Korean message.  But you're not
sure of the encoding it encoded.  As most Korean messages are encoded
in one of "euc-kr", "cp949", "UTF-8" or "UCS-2", you may use following
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(gdb) iconv value buffer #euc_kr #cp949 #utf_8 #ucs_2
Target encoding is UTF8:
EUC-KR: |asdf하이^@|
 CP949: |asdf하이^@|
 UTF-8: |asdf|
        iconv: illegal input sequence at position 4
 UCS-2: |獡晤쿇쳀|
        iconv: incomplete character or shift sequence at end of buffer
(gdb) _
#+END_SRC

From the above example, you know that the default system
encoding("Target encoding" in above) is UTF8.  Then it was encoded in
either one of EUC-KR or CP949.  (For your information, CP949 is a kind
of superset of EUC-KR.)  Then, you can see that it is definitely not
UTF-8 encoded, for iconv(1) prints an error message for that.

However, UCS-2 encoding output was interesting.  If you don't
recognize either Korean or Chinese, it will be difficult to guess.
But, the output from UCS-2 shows four letters; first two letters in
Chinses, and the second two letters in Korean.  In addition, =iconv(1)=
prints an error message that looks different from the message of
UTF-8.

In details, GDB 'iconv' sends full data to the =iconv(1)= command.  This
means the '\0' character itself also sent to =iconv(1)=.  That's why you
can see the strange output "^@" in the end of first two encodings
(EUC-KR and CP949).  Since a character in UCS-2 encoding uses 2-byte
(16bit), having only '\0' character in the end of the buffer makes
=iconv(1)= complaining about that it need 1 byte more.  That's why it
prints "incomplete character" in the error message.  To solve this,
you need to limit the data length so that GDB 'iconv' exclude the last
'\0' character.  The easiest way is to use GDB =iconv memory= command:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(gdb) ptype buffer
type = char [9]
(gdb) p/x buffer
$1 = {0x61, 0x73, 0x64, 0x66, 0xc7, 0xcf, 0xc0, 0xcc, 0x0}
(gdb) iconv memory buffer ((char*)buffer+8'') #euc_kr #cp949 #utf_8 #ucs_2
Target encoding is UTF8:
EUC-KR: |asdf하이|
 CP949: |asdf하이|
 UTF-8: |asdf|
        iconv: illegal input sequence at position 4
 UCS-2: |獡晤쿇쳀|
(gdb) _
#+END_SRC

By limiting the data sent, you'll find no error message was appeared
in UCS-2.  However, it contains meaningless characters, so we can
guess that the answer will be "The variable buffer contains a message
encoded either EUC-KR or CP949".

The reason that GDB =iconv= uses strange encoding format such as
"#iso_8859_10_1992", is to support auto-completion on encoding names.
I was not successful to use any of '-', '(', ')', or ':' on
auto-completion that GDB python interface provided.

* xmllint

If your program deals with XML document, or sends/receives a XML data,
you may need to verify the consitency of data in XML point of view.
For example, the XML syntax of the data may be broken or the data is
not compatible with your XML schema.  To solve this problem, GDB
=xmllint= command is provided:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
xmllint value EXPR [## OPTION...]
xmllint memory START_ADDR END_ADDR [## OPTION...]
#+END_SRC

As you expected, options of above command are in same context of GDB
=hexdump= command.

To check the XML validity of the variable, 'buffer', you need:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(gdb) xmllint value buffer
/tmp/gdb-AGFSXH:1: parser error : Opening and ending tag mismatch: items line 1 and item
session sessionid="copy3252345-600" status="completed" progress="????"/> </item>
                                                                               ^

                                                                               ^
/tmp/gdb-AGFSXH:1: parser error : Extra content at the end of the document

                                                                               ^
(gdb) _
#+END_SRC

If GDB =xmllint= could not find any error, it will dump the data like:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(gdb) xmllint value buffer
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<iq xmlns="jabber:client" from="cinsk@somewhere/res1" type="result"
to="cinsk@somewhere/res2" id="qewr"><info:query xmlns:info="http://
jabber.org/protocol/disco#info"><info:identity category="xmpp robot"
type="robot"/><info:features var="http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#
info"/><info:feature var="http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#items"/>
</info:query></iq>
(gdb) _
#+END_SRC

As you know, the data was supposed to be processed by the program, not
human, so it is hardly readable.  To format/indent the data for you,
human, use =xmllint(1)='s '--format' option:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(gdb) xmllint value buffer ## --format
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<iq xmlns="jabber:client" from="cinsk@somewhere/res1" type="result" to="cinsk@somewhere/res2" id="qewr">
  <info:query xmlns:info="http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info">
    <info:identity category="xmpp robot" type="robot"/>
    <info:features var="http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info"/>
    <info:feature var="http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#items"/>
  </info:query>
</iq>
(gdb) _
#+END_SRC

You can even uses your schema file to check against 'buffer':

#+BEGIN_SRC text
(gdb) xmllint value buffer ## --schema /somewhere/schema.xsd
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<iq xmlns="jabber:client" from="cinsk@somewhere/res1" type="result"
to="cinsk@somewhere/res2" id="qewr"><info:query xmlns:info="http://
jabber.org/protocol/disco#info"><info:identity category="xmpp robot"
type="robot"/><info:features var="http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#
info"/><info:feature var="http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#items"/>
</info:query></iq>
/tmp/gdb-4NR2cb:1: element features: Schemas validity error : Element
'{http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info}features': This element is not
expected. Expected is one of ( {http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info}
identity, {http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info}feature ).
/tmp/gdb-4NR2cb fails to validate

(gdb) _
#+END_SRC

That's all. :)
